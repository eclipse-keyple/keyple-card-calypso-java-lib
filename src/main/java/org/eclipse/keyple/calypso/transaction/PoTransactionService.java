 * Service providing the high-level API to manage transactions with a Calypso PO.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the type of operations required, the presence of a SAM may be necessary.
 *
 * <p>The {@link PoSmartCard} object provided to the build is kept and updated at each step of using
 * the service. It is the main container of the data handled during the transaction and acts as a
 * card image.
 *
 * <p>There are two main steps in using the methods of this service:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A command preparation step during which the application invokes prefixed "prepare" methods
 *       that will add to an internal list of commands to be executed by the PO. The incoming data
 *       to the PO are placed in {@link PoSmartCard}.
 *   <li>A processing step corresponding to the prefixed "process" methods, which will carry out the
 *       communications with the PO and if necessary the SAM. The outgoing data from the PO are
 *       placed in {@link PoSmartCard}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Technical or data errors, security conditions, etc. are reported as exceptions.

public interface PoTransactionService {
  /**
   * Opens a Calypso Secure Session and then executes all previously prepared commands.
   *
   * <p>It is the starting point of the sequence:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@link #processOpening(SessionAccessLevel)}
   *   <li>[{@link #processPoCommands()}]
   *   <li>[...]
   *   <li>[{@link #processPoCommands()}]
   *   <li>{@link #processClosing()}
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Each of the steps in this sequence may or may not be preceded by the preparation of one or
   * more commands and ends with an update of the {@link PoSmartCard} object provided when
   * PoTransactionService was created.
   *
   * <p>As a prerequisite for invoking this method, since the Calypso Secure Session involves the
   * use of a SAM, the PoTransactionService must have been built in secure mode, i.e. the
   * constructor used must be the one expecting a reference to a valid {@link PoSecuritySetting}
   * object, otherwise a {@link CalypsoPoTransactionIllegalStateException} is raised.
   *
   * <p>The secure session is opened with the {@link SessionAccessLevel} passed as an argument
   * depending on whether it is a personalization, reload or debit transaction profile..
   *
   * <p>The possible overflow of the internal session buffer of the PO is managed in two ways
   * depending on the setting chosen in {@link PoSecuritySetting}.
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>If the session was opened with the default atomic mode and the previously prepared
   *       commands will cause the buffer to be exceeded, then an {@link
   *       CalypsoAtomicTransactionException} is raised and no transmission to the PO is made. <br>
   *   <li>If the session was opened with the multiple session mode and the buffer is to be exceeded
   *       then a split into several secure sessions is performed automatically. However, regardless
   *       of the number of intermediate sessions performed, a secure session is opened at the end
   *       of the execution of this method.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Be aware that in the "MULTIPLE" case we lose the benefit of the atomicity of the secure
   * session.
   *
   * <p><b>PO and SAM exchanges in detail</b>
   *
   * <p>When executing this method, communications with the PO and the SAM are (in that order) :
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Sending the card diversifier (Calypso PO serial number) to the SAM and receiving the
   *       terminal challenge
   *   <li>Grouped sending to the PO (in a {@link CardRequest}) of
   *       <ul>
   *         <li>the open secure session command including the challenge terminal.
   *         <li>all previously prepared commands
   *       </ul>
   *   <li>Receiving grouped responses and updating {@link PoSmartCard} with the collected data.
   * </ul>
   *
   * For optimization purposes, if the first command prepared is the reading of a single record of a
   * PO file then this one is replaced by a setting of the session opening command allowing the
   * retrieval of this data in response to this command.
   *
   * <p><b>Other operations carried out</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The card KIF, KVC and card challenge received in response to the open secure session
   *       command are kept for a later initialization of the session's digest (see {@link
   *       #processClosing}).
   *   <li>All data received in response to the open secure session command and the responses to the
   *       prepared commands are also stored for later calculation of the digest.
   *   <li>If a list of authorized KVCs has been defined in {@link PoSecuritySetting} and the KVC of
   *       the card does not belong to this list then a {@link CalypsoUnauthorizedKvcException} is
   *       thrown.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>All unexpected results (communication errors, data or security errors, etc. are notified to
   * the calling application through dedicated exceptions.
   *
   * <p><i>Note: to understand in detail how the secure session works please refer to the PO
   * specification documents.</i>

   * <p><b>Stored Value</b>
   *
   * <p>If the SV counter was debited or reloaded during the session, an additional verification
   * specific to the SV is performed by the SAM.

   * <p><b>Ratification</b>
   *
   * <p>A ratification command is added after the close secure session command when the

   *       digest. The terminal signature calculation request is also integrated in the same {@link
   *       CardRequest} SAM.
   *   <li>All previously prepared commands are sent to the PO along with the session closing
   *       command and possibly the ratification command within a single {@link CardRequest}.
   *   <li>The responses received from the PO are integrated into PoSmartCard. <br>
