<p>This document is the specification of the API dedicated to the integration of the <strong>Calypso Card
    Extension</strong> in a<strong>Keyple Application</strong>.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    Use {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtensionProvider#getService()} to get the unique
    instance of the {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension} interface containing all the entry points
    provided by the extension:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Creation of a selection case targeting a specific PO to be provided to the <strong>Keyple Selection
        Service</strong>.<br>
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#createPoCardSelection(CardSelector poCardSelector, boolean acceptInvalidatedPo)}<br>
        A selection case targets a specific PO defined by an instance of {@link org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.selection.CardSelector}
        and possibly supplemented with commands to be executed after the selection (see methods of {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.po.PoCardSelection}).
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction service to perform non-secure operations with a PO.<br>
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#createPoUnsecuredTransaction(org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Reader reader, PoSmartCard poSmartCard)}
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction service to perform secure operations with a PO (<strong>Calypso Secure Session</strong>).<br>
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#createPoSecuredTransaction(org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Reader reader, PoSmartCard poSmartCard, PoSecuritySetting poSecuritySetting)}<br>
        The {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.transaction.PoSecuritySetting} POJO is used to define the security elements of the transaction.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The PO data collected at each step (selection, transaction) are stored in dedicated POJOs whose interfaces are
    available in the {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.po} package.</p>
