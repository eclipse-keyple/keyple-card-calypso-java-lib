<p>This document is the specification of the API dedicated to the integration of the <b>Calypso Card Extension</b> in a
    <b>Keyple
        Application</b>.</p>
<p>All the entry points of the extension are provided by the {@link
    org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension} interface.
<p>{@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtensionProvider#getService()} is to be used to get the unique instance
    of the extension.</p>
<p>The entry points are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One method to create a selection case to be provided to the <b>Keyple Selection Service</b>.
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#createPoSelection(CalypsoPoCardSelector
        calypsoPoCardSelector)}<br>
        It targets a specific PO defined by the POJO {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.po.CalypsoPoCardSelector} and
        possibly supplemented with commands to be executed after the selection (see methods of {@link
        org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.po.CalypsoPoCardSelection}).
    </li>
    <li>Two methods to configure the SAM resource service needed to process secure operations with POs.<br>
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#getSamResourceService()} and {@link
        org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#getPoSecuritySettingBuilder(java.lang.String samProfileName)}.
    </li>
    <li>Two methods to provide two types of transaction services: non-secure and secure.<br>
        {@link
        org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#createPoUnsecuredTransaction(org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Reader
        reader, CalypsoPoSmartCard calypsoPoSmartCard)}<br>
        {@link
        org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.CalypsoCardExtension#createPoSecuredTransaction(org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Reader
        reader, CalypsoPoSmartCard calypsoPoSmartCard, PoSecuritySetting poSecuritySetting)}
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The PO data collected at each step (selection, transaction) are stored in dedicated POJOs whose interfaces are
    available in the {@link org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.po} package.</p>
