<p>This document is the specification of the API dedicated to the integration of the <strong>Calypso Card
    Extension</strong> in a <strong>Keyple Application</strong>.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    Use {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.CalypsoExtensionServiceProvider#getService()} to get the unique
    instance of the {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.CalypsoExtensionService} interface containing all the entry points
    provided by the extension:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Creation of a selection case targeting a specific card to be provided to the <strong>Keyple Selection
        Service</strong>.<br>
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.CalypsoExtensionService#createCardSelection(CardSelector cardSelector, boolean acceptInvalidatedCard)}<br>
        A selection case targets a specific card defined by an instance of {@link org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.selection.CardSelector}
        and possibly supplemented with commands to be executed after the selection (see methods of {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.card.CalypsoCardSelection}).
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction service to perform non-secure operations with a card.<br>
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.CalypsoExtensionService#createCardTransactionWithoutSecurity(org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Reader reader, CalypsoCard calypsoCard)}
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction service to perform secure operations with a card (<strong>Calypso Secure Session</strong>).<br>
        {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.CalypsoExtensionService#createCardTransaction(org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Reader reader, CalypsoCard calypsoCard, CardSecuritySetting cardSecuritySetting)}<br>
        The {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.transaction.CardSecuritySetting} POJO is used to define the security elements of the transaction.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The card data collected at each step (selection, transaction) are stored in dedicated POJOs whose interfaces are
    available in the {@link org.eclipse.keyple.card.calypso.card} package.</p>
